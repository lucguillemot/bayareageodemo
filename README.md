# San Francisco Bay Area census tracts classification
This project aims at creating a classification of the Bay Area neighborhoods using hierachical clustering on Census data.
This type of classification is directly inspired by works in the 'geodemographics' field, especially the [London Output Area Classification](http://loac.datashine.org.uk/) and [this article](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00045608.2015.1052335) by Seth Spielman and Alex Singleton on how to use uncertain data from the American Community Survey to study neighborhoods in the US.
